# Welcome to Nusion Converter

Nusion is a "Nuke to Fusion" node converter that converts nodes between Foundry's Nuke and Blackmagic Design's Fusion Studio compositing software. Simply copy a node from your active Nuke composite, and allow Nusion to remap the Nuke node and its attributes into the nearest equivalent node available in Resolve Studio/Fusion Studio. Simple and easy.

Nusion is available as a self-hosted web app that runs directly in your web browser. The new plugin integration version of "Nusion for Fusion" can be installed in Resolve's Fusion page/Fusion Studio using the community maintained Reactor Package manager. The "Nusion for Fusion" plugin allows you to access a "Edit &gt; Paste Nusion" menu item. This will take a Foundry Nuke node from your clipboard and instantly translate it into the corresponding Fusion Studio node. The result is pasted directly into your Fusion flow, ready for use.

## Screenshots

Nusion can run from your web browser using a local Nusion Server session hosted on your workstation.

If you have Blackmagic Fusion Studio, the "Paste Nusion" menu entry and Lua comp script allows you to convert a Foundry Nuke .nk node snippet into a BMD Fusion Studio native node. The "Shift + N" hotkey can also be used to carry out the conversion task.
